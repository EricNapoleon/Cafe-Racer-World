    <p> <h2 style="text-align: center;">The story</h2>
        <br>
        Launched in 2006 Return of the Cafe Racers is one of the internet’s longest running cafe racer and custom motorcycle websites.
         With a social media following in excess of 700,000 it is also one of the biggest, reaching a massive global audience.
       
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a Cafe Racér?</h2>
        <br>
        Cafe Racers are a style of custom motorcycle that emerged in England in the 1950s. They were built
         by riders who wanted to recreate race bikes that were unavailable to the public. Riders would strip
          down factory bikes and make speed and handling focused modifications.
        Cafe Racers were typically ridden by Rockers or “Ton-Up Boys”.
        <br>
         They could often be seen congregating
         at transport cafes close to Britains arterial highways. The cafes were often used as a starting/finishing
          point for illegal street races.
        Today the cafe racer style remains true and many manufacturers now produce off-the-shelf cafe racers.
